## 1. Building the Application

Loop of snake has been developed in a Maven repository utilizing the multi-module approach. To launch this game, it is necessary to open two separate terminals.

In the first terminal, you will start the server module. This module is responsible for managing interactions between players and maintaining the overall state of the game. 

In the second terminal, you will launch the client module. The client is the interface through which players interact with the game. This module communicates with the server to send commands and receive updates on the game's state.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the Java Runtime Environment 17 (JRE) or Java Development Kit 17 (JDK) installed on your computer. The version of Java should be compatible with the application.

### Step 1: Install Java
- Install the **Java Runtime Environment 17** or **Java Development Kit 17**.
- Ensure the Java version is compatible with the application.
- You can check your Java version by running `java -version` in the command line.

### Step 2: Set File Permissions (Unix/Linux Only)
- On Unix/Linux systems, you might need to make the JAR file executable:

  ```bash
  chmod +x path/to/jar.jar
  ```

### Step 3: Dependencies

## 3. Application Protocol

## 3.1 Overview
The Loop of Legend (LOL) protocol is designed specifically for online multiplayer snake games, operating on a client-server architecture. This protocol facilitates real-time interactions and gameplay over a network, providing a seamless gaming experience.

- The main objective of the LOL protocol is to enable players to play the classic snake game in a networked, multiplayer environment.
- Players (clients) connect to a central game server. The server manages game lobbies, player actions, and game state updates.
- To start a game, a client connects to the server and requests to join a game. The game begins when the lobby has sufficient players, and all players indicate they are ready.

## 3.2 Transport protocol
### Protocol and port
- **Protocol**: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) for reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of game data.
- **Port**: The default communication port for the LOL protocol is 20000.

### Connection Initiation
- The connection is initiated by the client.
- The client sends an `INIT` message to the server to establish a connection.
- The server, upon receiving the `INIT` message, responds with `DONE` if the connection is successfully established.

## 3.3 Messages/Actions
The client can send the following messages:
- `INIT`: Start the connection.
- `LOBB`: Check lobby availability.
- `JOIN`: Join the game lobby.
- `RADY`: Indicating readiness for the game.
- `DIRE <direction>`: Indicating the snake's direction.
    - `0`: Up direction
    - `1`: Down direction
    - `2`: Left direction
    - `3`: Right direction

The server can send the following messages:
- `DONE`: Indicating successful completion of the previous request. See details below.
- `STRT`: Signaling the start of the game.
- `REPT`: Reporting game events or status.
- `UPTE <map>`: Used to send the map. Updating the game state.
- `EROR`: Error message for any issues encountered. See details below.
- `ENDD`: Indicates the end of the game.

Common messages
- `MSGG`: This message is used for general communication within the game. It can be employed for various purposes, such as sending information about current actions. The specific content of the message would depend on the context in which it is used.
- `QUIT`: This message is sent when exiting the game. Upon receiving a QUIT message, the server typically performs cleanup operations related to the client, such as removing the player from the game lobby or freeing up resources.
- `UNKN`: This message represents an unknown or invalid command. This could happen if there's a typo in the command, the client uses a command not supported by the server or the message format is incorrect.

### Success/Error Codes
- `DONE`: This code indicates that an action requested by the client has been completed successfully. For example, when a player successfully joins a lobby, the server might respond with a `DONE` message. It's a general acknowledgment sent from the server to confirm that the requested operation was executed without any issues.
- `EROR`: This code signifies that an error occurred while processing the client's request. It is usually followed by an error message that provides more details about the nature of the error. Examples of situations that might generate an `EROR` message include attempts to join a full game lobby. The accompanying error message helps in understanding the specific reason for the failure.

### Edge-Cases Handling
- **Full Lobby**: In cases where a client attempts to join a game lobby that is already full, the server responds with a specific `EROR` message indicating that the lobby is at capacity.
- **Username Already Taken**: When a client attempts to register or join with a username that is already in use, the server responds with a specific `REPT` message indicating that the username is unavailable. This message can guide the user to choose an alternative username.
- **Socket Closed/Disconnection**: If the client's connection to the server is unexpectedly closed (e.g., due to a socket closure), the client's termnal will display a notification message to the user. This message informs the user about the disconnection. This straightforward communication helps the user understand that the issue is related to the network connection and guides them on the immediate steps they can take. The client's application is responsible for detecting when the socket has been closed.
